    description2: "I have completed my SSC from Srimati saraswatibai nistane vidyalaya with 84 %. In H.S.C, I have got 81% after passing HSC, I was a little confused. I didn't know which profession I should go. In some corner of my heart,  I was thinking of doing poly . And in second mind, it was engineering going in my mind. I was completely blocked at that time. But after a few days, I heard about coding. One of my friends told me coding is our future. Why not to join coding classes ? In fact we have a better school for this profession which is Masai School. At least, we try this course. It is in demand. What say? I agreed to it and joined Masai school. And I am proud of myself that I was at the right decision. Coz I am a part of that field now which teaches coding. Just love this profession.And talking about my interest - I am fond of learning new things and reading quotes.",
